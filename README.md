An automatic currency conversion component for React that Just Works<sup>‚Ñ¢</sup>.

‚ú® [Try it for yourself with this demo](https://jasonbarry.github.io/react-world-price) ‚ú®


## Features

- Dead simple API
- Always up-to-date currency exchange rates, cached locally
- Formatted the way users expect
- 32 currencies supported
- 8.6kB minified, 3.4kB gzipped, works in all major browsers, React 0.14 and up

## Installation and usage

Add it to your project:

	yarn add react-world-price

(**Note:** You'll need a promise polyfill if you're not using one already for this to work in browsers that don't support promises natively. I recommend [promise-polyfill](https://github.com/taylorhakes/promise-polyfill).)

Import it anywhere:

```JSX
import WorldPrice from 'react-world-price';
```

If the prices you're converting are already based in USD, then all you need to do is e.g.

```JSX
<p>The dress is on sale for <WorldPrice amount={123.45} />.</p>
```

to get prices displaying in the user's home currency.

## Props

Only the `amount` prop is required.

Prop | Description
--------- | -----------
`amount` | (*Number. Required. No default value*) <br /> The amount you are converting.
`baseCurrency` | (*String. Optional. Default value: `USD`*) <br /> The currency you are converting from. This should be the same value for all instances so that prices are normalized.
`displayCurrency` | (*String. Optional. Default value: Determined by user's locale, fallback to `USD`*) <br /> The currency you are converting to. The user's browser language (i.e. `navigator.language`) is consulted to determine a default value. <br /> **Note:** If you already know the user's preferred currency (based on data you collect), it is recommended to include it.
`hideCents` | (*Boolean. Optional. Default value: `false`*) <br /> Whether to omit digits after the decimal point, if they exist.
`rounding` | (*Function. Optional. Default value: `Math.round`*) <br /> Rounding function.
`unwrap` | (*Boolean. Optional. Default value: `false`*) <br /> When `false`, returns a pure string; when `true`, returns a `<span>` element with the original unconverted price set as its `title` attribute.

## Output

By default, a `<span>` element is outputted for every instance of `WorldPrice`. 

For example, 

```JSX
<WorldPrice amount={123.45} displayCurrency="EUR" />
```

translates to 

```JSX
<span title="$123.45 USD">‚Ç¨99.08</span>
```

## Examples

In the following examples, you'll see the output for a user in the United States, and for a user in Germany.

```JSX
<WorldPrice amount={8675.309} />
```
    
> User in the United States sees `$8,675.31`
> 
> User in Germany sees `‚Ç¨6.944,67`

```JSX
<WorldPrice amount={8675.309} displayCurrency="EUR" />
```
    
> User in the United States sees `‚Ç¨6,944.67`
> 
> User in Germany sees `‚Ç¨6.944,67`.

### Rounding

```JSX
<WorldPrice amount={8675.309} rounding={Math.floor} />
```
    
For the `en-US` locale, outputs `$8,675.30`.

```JSX
<WorldPrice amount={8675.309} rounding={Math.floor} hideCents />
```
    
For the `en-US` locale, outputs `$8,675`.

```JSX
<WorldPrice amount={8675.309} rounding={Math.ceil} />
```
    
For the `en-US` locale, outputs `$8,675.31`.

```JSX
<WorldPrice amount={8675.309} rounding={Math.ceil} hideCents />
```
    
For the `en-US` locale, outputs `$8,676`.

## Data

Exchange rate data comes from [Fixer](http://fixer.io). 

The Fixer API will only be consulted once per unique base currency per day, no matter how many `WorldPrice` instances you have per page. 

The data is cached via localStorage if available, falling back to cookies.
